# Weather
Weather app case for CTK

The program requires the library JSON-java to work properly. It can be downloaded from the link below.

The weather app is best run by opening the Weather-main folder using a java IDE of choice, and running the main method in the Application class.
The app then opens a window, in which the user can input the name of a city.
After a city has been put in, a new window with several options will appear.
